Actius and Passivs. 35

(b) A Sentence containing a Relative word is often
called an AdJ‘ectivcl Olcuse, because it qualifies a
Noun like an Adjectivc.

Est mihi mensa, quae est nigra
Ι bace c blank table.

A Relative Olause may be omitted without altering the
construction of any other word in the sentence

(c) A Relative word is osten omitted in Englishj
but never in Latin.

Wbere is tte table Ι saw yestcrday?
Ubi est ea mensu, qaam heri vidit

(d) The Relative always comes first in its own
Clauso (except aiter Propositions), and generally next

to the word it qualifies.
Relative words are-

Qui, qualis, quantus,
Quo, qua, unde, nbi.
